# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction

Predicting whether a customer will churn using machine learning, with a focus on business impact and model explainability using SHAP.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Customer churn is a major challenge for subscription-based businesses, directly impacting profitability. This project builds a supervised learning model to predict churn based on customer demographics, service usage, and payment behavior.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Customers on **month-to-month contracts** are more likely to churn.
- **High monthly charges** correlate with higher churn.
- **Electronic check payment method** is associated with increased churn.
- **Long-tenured customers** are more likely to stay.

Plots created using seaborn and matplotlib can be found in the EDA notebook.

## 🧠 Model Development

We trained three classification models:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine

### 📈 Performance Summary (Test Set)

| Model               | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score | ROC AUC |
|---------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| Logistic Regression | 0.786    | 0.623     | 0.495  | 0.551    | **0.831** |
| Random Forest       | 0.792    | 0.649     | 0.479  | 0.551    | 0.816    |
| SVM                 | **0.795**| **0.665** | 0.457  | 0.542    | 0.784    |

| 📊 Metric       | Logistic Regression |
|----------------|----------------------|
| 🧪 Accuracy     | 78.6%               |
| 🎯 Precision    | 62.3%               |
| 📉 Recall       | 49.5%               |
| ⚖️ F1 Score     | 55.1%               |
| 📈 ROC AUC      | 83.1%               |

✅ **Logistic Regression was selected as the final model** due to its higher ROC AUC and interpretability.

## 🧪 Sample Prediction

Here’s a sample churn prediction scenario:

> **Customer Profile**
> - Tenure: 2 months  
> - Contract Type: Month-to-month  
> - Monthly Charges: $80  
> - Internet Service: Fiber optic  
> - Payment Method: Electronic check

**🔍 Prediction Result**:  
**Churn = Yes** (74% probability)

**Key Reasons (via SHAP)**:
- Contract is month-to-month (major churn driver)
- High monthly charges
- Short tenure

## 🔍 Model Explainability (SHAP)

To improve transparency, we used SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) to explain model predictions:

- **Top Churn Drivers**:
  - Contract type (month-to-month)
  - Short customer tenure
  - High monthly charges

This explains why an individual customer is predicted to churn.

## 🔮 Future Development

This project can be expanded in the following ways:

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model performance.
- **Advanced Models**: Test ensemble methods like XGBoost or Gradient Boosting Machines.
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: Use SMOTE or weighted loss functions to improve recall.
- **Automated Pipeline**: Refactor notebooks into a full pipeline using `train_model.py`, `evaluate_model.py`, etc.
- **Deployment**: Build a web app using **Streamlit** or deploy an API using **FastAPI** to serve predictions.
- **Monitoring & Retraining**: Add model drift monitoring and automate periodic retraining on new data.
- **Dashboard Integration**: Build an interactive dashboard with **Power BI** or **Plotly Dash** for business stakeholders.
