# Customer Churn Prediction

# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction

Predicting whether a customer will churn using machine learning, with a focus on business impact and model explainability.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Customer churn has a significant impact on revenue. This project aims to develop a predictive model to identify high-risk customers before they leave, enabling proactive retention strategies.

---

## 📊 Problem Statement

**Goal**: Classify whether a customer will churn based on behavioral and demographic attributes.

**Business Value**: Improve customer retention through targeted interventions, reducing churn-related losses.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**, **pandas**, **scikit-learn**, **matplotlib**, **seaborn**
- Jupyter notebooks for development and storytelling
- Feature engineering, model selection, evaluation metrics
- Placeholder for deployment: `Flask` or `FastAPI` (to be added)

## 📈 Features Used

- Customer demographics (gender, senior citizen, tenure)
- Service usage patterns (internet, phone, contract type)
- Billing and payment details (monthly charges, payment method)

---

## 🧠 Model Pipeline (Coming Soon)

- Data Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering
- Model Training: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
- Evaluation: ROC-AUC, Precision, Recall
- SHAP/Feature Importance (Explainability)

---

## 📌 Key Insights (To Be Added)

- High churn among customers with month-to-month contracts
- Electronic check payment method associated with higher churn
- Long-tenured customers less likely to churn

---

## 🚧 TODOs

- [ ] Add preprocessing script in `src/`
- [ ] Implement ML pipeline and evaluation
- [ ] Include SHAP-based model explainability
- [ ] Deploy via API or Streamlit (optional)
